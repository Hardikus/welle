# Welle

Monger is an experimental idiomatic Clojure wrapper around Riak Java driver.


## Usage

Since these are very early days of the library, it is fair to say that it is *completely unusable* to anyone
other than the author.


## This is a Work In Progress

Welle is very much a work in progress and right now, there is nothing to
see here, really.
