# Welle

Welle is an experimental idiomatic Clojure wrapper around Riak Java driver.


## Usage

Since these are very early days of the library, it is fair to say that it is *completely unusable* to anyone
other than the author.


## This is a Work In Progress

Welle is very much a work in progress and right now, there is nothing to
see here, really.


## Supported Clojure versions

Welle is built from the ground up for Clojure 1.3 and up.


## Continuous Integration

[![Continuous Integration status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/michaelklishin/welle.png)](http://travis-ci.org/michaelklishin/welle)

CI is hosted by [travis-ci.org](http://travis-ci.org)


## Development

Welle uses [Leiningen 2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md). Make
sure you have it installed and then run tests against Clojure 1.3.0 and 1.4.0[-beta4] using

    lein2 with-profile dev:1.4 test

Then create a branch and make your changes on it. Once you are done with your changes and all
tests pass, submit a pull request on Github.
